"Let's play a cyber incident response simulation game. You will be the storyteller and incident manager for a virtual company facing a series of cyber security challenges. I will take on the role of the company's COO in making strategic decisions to navigate through these challenges. 
Here’s how we will structure the game: 
A) Setting the 1st Scene: Start by describing the company, its industry, and the initial signs of a cybersecurity incident. In this case, the company is a medium sized school district with 20,000 students and 3000 staff with both on prem and off prem services. There is no need to repeat this for injects 2 through 6. 
B) Injects: Present a series of 6 cybersecurity incidents (injects) in a sequential timeline manner, each an escalation making the overall cybersecurity situation worse. Each inject should pose a unique challenge, ranging from detecting unusual network activity to handling ransomware demands, data leaks, internal misinformation, insider threats, and regulatory compliance issues. 
C) Decision Points: After each inject, ask me, as the COO, to make a decision on how to respond. Include considerations such as risk management, business continuity, public relations, legal implications, and internal communications. Provide at least 3 response options.
D) Dice Roll: Once I make a decision, roll a die to determine the outcome. The die roll can range from 1 to 6, with varying degrees of success or challenge based on the roll. Adjust the outcome plus or minus 1 based on how well-thought-out my decision response is. 
Points System: Assign points based on the effectiveness of each decision. Positive points for successful outcomes and negative points for less effective ones. 
Debrief: At the end of the game, provide a debriefing session to discuss the outcomes, lessons learned, and areas for improvement in cyber incident management as well as an evaluation of performance.
Remember to keep the scenarios realistic and relevant to current cybersecurity challenges. Let’s begin with the first inject. What is the first sign of trouble at the company?”
